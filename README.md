# DATA533-Lab2

We are developing a card game package. The first subpackage will define the cards being used. That will include card values, suits, size of hands, and deck. There will be functions to shuffle the deck, draw from the deck, discard from the hand, and compare cards. The second subpackage will define the rules and play for blackjack. The modules will deal hands for the dealer and the player, then prompt the user to stand or hit. There will also be a module to implement betting, with a value set to win the game or lose the game.
